FEATURES TO ADD IN THE FUTURE:
==============================

1. Allow use as a module, with a parameter recognizing substructures of the special types (like date encoding), and thus generate them.
2. Export to other languages:
    * JSON Schema (WAML?)
    * OCaml code
    * Java
3. Try to validate/reconstruct schemas of the documents in JSON database like MongoDB.
4. Add plugins for user type detection:
    * Date/datetimes
    * URLs
    * int vs double
5. Subtyping relation
6. Algebraic sum encoding:
    * transcriptic.com example ("op")
7. Try integration as GHC preprocessor
8. Try integration with Cabal build system.
