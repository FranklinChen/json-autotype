Automatic typing JSON
=====================

Story about practical web-service development using type theory.

JSON is a subset of JavaScript, and thus the most convenient data
interchange format for Web 2.0 applications. Structured Web APIs which are
mostly exposed as in JSON messages can often produce huge
readouts that need to be integrated into more complex applications,
not only simple mash-ups.

Since Haskell excels in precise description of complex secure systems,
it enjoys relatively large set of parsing, validation, and web libraries.

JSON-Autotype was born out of the need to facilitate automatic creation of
large Web API interfaces in Haskell, and uses union typing
in the directions pointed by need to represent ad-hoc type discovery.

During the seminar I will introduce problem by examples, and provide
solutions to most frequent problems of type-based interface discovery
and interaction validation.
